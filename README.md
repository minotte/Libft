<h1 align="center"> Libft </h>

## Project

Libft is the first project in the 42 program. 
to understand basic C functions. We need to create our own lib so that we can use it on all future projects. 

## Subject

## Constraints

The whole files of the projects need to follow 42 norm.

## Part 3 - Bonus functions

Subject bonus part aim to teach the chained list to the students. Each function is designed to work with the following struct:

```clike=
typedef struct s_list
{
	void		*content;
	struct s_list	*next;
} t_list;
```

|      Name        | Description                                                                              |

## Usage

``make`` to compile.

``clean`` to clean all compiled files without the library file.

``fclean`` to clean all compiled files with the library file.

``re`` to fclean then make.
